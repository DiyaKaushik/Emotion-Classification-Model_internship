# Emotion Classification Project

This project aims to build an emotion classification model using various machine learning frameworks and libraries, including Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face. The user interface for the model is developed using Streamlit and Gradio, providing an interactive experience for users.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd emotion-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data` directory and update the `data/README.md` file with relevant information about the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory to perform EDA and model training.
3. **Model Training**: Choose the desired framework (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face) and implement your model in the corresponding file in the `src` directory.
4. **User Interface**: Run the Streamlit or Gradio application to interact with your emotion classification model.
