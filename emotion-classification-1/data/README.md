# Dataset Documentation for Emotion Classification Project

This README file provides information about the dataset used in the Emotion Classification project.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of text samples labeled with various emotions. It is used to train and evaluate emotion classification models. The dataset may include different formats such as CSV, JSON, or text files.

## Data Structure

The dataset typically contains the following columns:

- **text**: The text input for emotion classification.
- **emotion**: The corresponding emotion label for the text (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, etc.).

## Data Preprocessing

Before using the dataset for training, the following preprocessing steps are usually performed:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words.
2. **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical format suitable for model training.

## Usage

To use the dataset in your project, ensure that it is placed in the appropriate directory and follow the data loading procedures defined in the `src/data_preprocessing.py` file.

## License

Please refer to the dataset's original source for licensing information. Ensure compliance with any usage restrictions or requirements.
